    "\n",
    "2. Then, you make two `IF` blocks whether the survey allow participants to take the survey or not. \n",
    "  - `NO`\n",
    "    - When the participants choose `No`, we need to end the survey. So add `End of Survey`, and make it `customize`. \n",
    "    - Click the third button (Custom) and select \"my library\" and click \"New message\". Because you need to create \"message\" when the participants don't want to take the survey. You can also add or edit on the \"Library\" tab on the right top, and go to \"Message Library\". \n",

    "    - Set font and size. \n",

    "    - But we need to add `End of Survey` on the last list of this survey flow. So, go to the bottom, and add `End ot Survey`\n",
    "    - In this case, we create the same block like \"No\" case, and create the message for Yes case. \n",
    "    - Add this message for Yes case. \n",
    "    - Set font and size\n",

    "2. Go to `Survey link`, because we use Qualtrics. \n",
    "3. Click `create survey`\n",

    "7. `Design Layout` should be the same it on your IRB protocol. \n",
    "8. Add `Survey link`\n",
    "    For Survey link, when you publish your survey on Qualtrics at first time, it will give you your survey link. Also, you can check your link on `Distribution` tab, `Anonymous Survey Link` and you can copy and paste it to `Survey link`. \n",
